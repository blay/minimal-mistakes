comment: '<p>But what also results is a new awareness of the way in which relations must<br>always mean the creation of a new assemblage, even if a temporary one. If two jets<br>collide in mid-air and fly away burning, we normally think of this situation in terms of<br>mutual qualitative effects on two independent entities. A better analysis, in DeLandian<br>terms, would be that the two jets briefly formed a new entity, which damaged both of<br>them through the assemblage power known as “retroactive effect on parts,” then<br>decomposed into separate entities again, this time fully aflame. In other words, causation<br>means primarily creating a new object, not new effects on pre-existent objects. The two<br>flaming jets, spiraling to their doom, are more symptoms of causation than embodiments<br>of it.</p>'
