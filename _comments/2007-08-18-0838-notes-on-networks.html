comment: '<p>"<br>since the average distance between any two persons are only about three links.<br>"</p><p>Aside from the myth about six on _average_ (coming from Milgram) it''s interesting to see how this number is able to shrink even further when rumor spreads (down to three!). Thus there is something very social and appealing here about the idea..</p>'
