comment: '<p>Thanks Magnus! For us working with civil disobedience, to nonviolently and openly break the law, we get charged for conspiracy, not because our law-breaking would be secret, but because we are planning our crime together.</p><p>Con-spire comes from breathing together. Breathing together is to live together, or creating life together. For us it means bother, to live together, and to create life which is a crime. The crime is the life we are creating together.</p><p>(sorry about my English, I learned English in the U.S prison but I am Swedish speaking.)</p>'
