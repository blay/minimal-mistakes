comment: '<p>Inser att jag inte borde sitta och blogga just nu, lägger tills vidare in citat från texten jag nämnde ovan ("Economy of the germ: capital, accumulation and<br>vibration", <i>E&amp;S</i>, vol 36, no. 4). Lepinay skriver:</p><p>"One reading of Tarde’s germ theory draws him towards a flattening of the purported intensity logged in it. It is the actor network theory understanding of economies and it borrows such concepts as compatibility and normalization, convergence and alignment. If one follows this interpretation of Tarde, it dilutes the germ into a network of alliances<br>and compatibilities. A germ would possess this unique ability to survive, because it is attached to many networks and not just one. [...] Only the location of the germ - as a node in between several lines of interlinking entities - would make it what it is. [...] Vibration would thus be nothing but a context characteristic, or more exactly a quality of the germ fitting contexts."</p><p>Han fortsätter: "The problem with the compatibility reduction of the germ is that it offers a very poor version of the strategy of difference. Describing this strategy in terms of its outcomes - the making of alliances and connections - does not exhaust the mechanism of a germ that can actually not only put together so far unrelated contexts, but also transform its own ability to achieve connections. It is the difference between a bacteria and water. The former not only tries and errs when surrounded with a new environment; it adapts its architecture to use this environment. [...] When germ is understood as intensities and potentialities, rather than as<br>operator of compatibility, [a] germ can be promising."</p><p>Han avslutar: "Vibrations are the origin of the economy, but they escape measurement when they are observed in their purest form of a potential. Only when it materializes does it become an object for economists’ toolbox. Prior to this slowing down of the germ into a book or a method, its relentless vibration is bound to fail as much as to succeed, but it is too indecisive to be seized with enough certainty."</p>'
