comment: '<p>Hi, Just found your blog surfing on the internet! I am too much interested in the information like you are providing. Why you do not write a new ebook and publish it by collecting more information on this topic. NO! Do not take me wrong! I am not a publisher. Ha! Ha! Ha!  You have written in a detailed manner that''s why I am asking you about the ebooks. Have you ever thought of any type of ebook and in its business. It is a really hardwork to create a blog like yours and to maintain it. But you have done really a great job. Congrates! I have few questions. Do you think that blogs are better than ebooks for providing information and making money. I Just take the ebooks as products. I have never tried to write any ebook and to do any sort of business. If I say something about my website here, then you will consider this comment as a spam and NO One like that. But would like to say, that while selling FREE EBOOKS I have made such a huge amount, just in few days, that you will be amazed! If you visit my website (by clicking on my name in this comment) then you are bound to be surprised. I am sure this is a new technique of selling, I have found over the net. But lets talk about writing ebooks and providing unique information to the internet community, have you ever tried writing anything and publishing it? Do you also sell ebooks? What is your experience? I am interested in knowing about it or your experiments? Waiting for reply - Thanks, Regards</p>'
