comment: '<p>Note on note 3: This has consequences for social networks. This might be a flaw in Jaiku (not so much in Facebook, which is the other network I use).<br>The information you get from Jaiku is basically pointless if it is not related to close friends, even for an aquaintance its not so much use to know that they are eating or if they''re working and so on. Jaiku was designed to give you the immediate presence of people you socialize with on a regular basis.</p><p>And I''ve heard people complaining on jaiku that all there is there is their regular friends that they know about with or without Jaiku. Facebook might be a bit more focused on acquaintances and should therefor be more "useful".</p>'
