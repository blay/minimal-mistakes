comment: '<p>Men det finns ju fordelar med wiki ocksa: "One benefit of the <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiNow" rel="nofollow">WikiNow </a> is that there is always more time. On a wiki, it may not matter whether you respond in an hour or a month. Two weeks is rarely important. Moreover, if you can''''t think of something to say, or if you forget to say something, someone in the future may say it. Conversations can last years, can be dropped by individuals, and can be picked up by others.That''''s not to say that being lazy is the way to go. Like anything, human attention spans are small. If nothing happens for a long period of time, people are likely to forget or stop caring. However, on a wiki, there is less pressure than on a WebLog to respond quickly. Taking time to consider your response is encouraged. No such thing as a FirstPost here."</p>'
