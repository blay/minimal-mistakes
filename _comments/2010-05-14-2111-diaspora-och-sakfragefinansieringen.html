comment: '<p>I don''t really mind that someone making a website that people can use to get money take a fee of 5% on it. Of course it''s up to anyone to make a competing website and maintain it without making a fee, but for all to run smoothly in the scale that kickstarter operates on I think it is necessary to get some money of your own. At least to be able to spend full time on it.</p><p>But like you say, on a smaller scale there are more options available and there is much to be done on the scale of projects needing say less than 1000 euros and how that can be achieved in a super fast way. On the larger scale I think the problem might be the "we" that need to chip in. Often crowd-funding projects keep within one community, like an art community or an activist community (like the classic support party beer/soup). But at a certain scale, money need to flow from other communities as well.</p><p>And that''s the other point of the post, that maybe it''s time to re-think this DIY-thing and how it can be scaled up to have more impact than small scale art and music projects, even though they are important too. But how about houses, medical research, projects a group needs to live off for several years.</p><p>Just like facebook is no problem to get out off on an individual basis if you don''t mind hanging out with nerds and geeks or your friends on other communities. But one thing I noticed for example when facebook got big and I was living in Malm√∂ was that it had an immediate effect on how many people came to independent galleries or black clubs or temporary gigs. This scene managed to scale up because of facebook, new practices became available because of how facebook could be used to support them. Now I see that this is partly because facebook was an event and much new things were exposed with it and it probably don''t have this effect today but could be taken over by something else.</p>'
