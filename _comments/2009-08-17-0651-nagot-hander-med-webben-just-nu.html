comment: '<p><a href="http://ruk.ca" rel="nofollow" title="Peter Rukavina">My friend Peter''s blog</a> has <a href="http://ruk.ca/content/lessons-ive-learned-my-gallbladder?page=4" rel="nofollow">a post about some disease symptom he had</a>. Gall bladder, or kidney stone, or whatever it was. The blog post tells a story, and it gets well-ranked in search engines. It''s got hundreds of comments, building an instant micro-community. People add their story of the same thing. All without Peter inviting them, or they really engaging in the rest of his blog.</p>'
