On the Internet, the municipality of Hörby in southerns Sweden is known as Horby (<a href="http://www.horby.se" rel="nofollow">www.horby.se</a>). One part of the name, -by, means village or hamlet in Swedish. Unfortunately, the meaning of the Swedish word hor is adultery or fornication [related to the English word whore]. [...]</p><p>How could things go so wrong? To explain why Hörby became Horby [...] on the Internet, this chapter takes a closer look at computer character set standards and their consequences. We thereby look at questions whose answers [...] have to do with the, in many respects, invisible infrastructure of the Internet. </p>'
