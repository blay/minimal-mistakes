comment: '<p>Free (in file sharing) and open (in p2p) is not representations of ideal states that we should try to reach, but rather they function as attractors that heats up the system where they are applied, and to various degrees, melts away the frozen positions of that system. Some systems might only melt a bit on the surface, creating a less rigid form and smooth edges, some might be entirely liquified and freely flowin, only with some icebergs floating on to.</p>'
