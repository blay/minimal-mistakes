comment: '<p>Also worth noting is that Bauwens concept of p2p production refers to planned, framed, projects with formalised rules, defined structures of authority and strong social ties. Most empirical examples of the p2p dynamic will probably be more "dirty" and spontaneous, entangled with other forms of organization and hierarchies.</p>'
