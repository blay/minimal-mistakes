comment: '<p>Stycke fr√•n Thrift:s "Knowing Capitalism":<br>There is a further consequence of this new managerialist discourse. It<br>makes it even clearer (if this ever needed saying) that there is no intellectual<br>community which can be separated off from other communities, in<br>which the intellectual community has the power to decode the world,<br>whilst all the other communities just slope ignorantly about. As Bauman<br>(1987) has pointed out, the intellectual community has moved from a position<br>as legislator of the world to simply one of a number of interpretive<br>communities. In the case of the relationship between the international intellectual<br>and international business community this tendency has been<br>strengthened by increased traffic between the two communities (for example,<br>as a result of the growth of management education, and the increasing<br>use of intellectual ideas in management), by the growth of an independent<br>intelligence and analytical capacity within international business, and by the<br>growth of the media as powerful disseminators of and traders in ideas<br>between the two communities.</p>'
